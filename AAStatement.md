UNIFIED FORMAL VERIFICATION OF THE INVENTION

The three provisional applications incorporated herein by reference  disclose inventions that are not independent but are mathematically unified under a single orchestration principle that simultaneously:
(i) enforces substrate independence via perpendicular divergence,
(ii) preserves geometric structure via Grassmannian holonomy, and
(iii) guarantees physical consistency via thermodynamic holonomy.

A complete, machine-checked proof of this unified theory in Cubical Agda is attached as Appendix Z. The proof establishes, by computational theorem proving:

• Theorem 4.1 — Perpendicular divergence is zero if and only if substrates are probabilistically identical and geometrically parallel
• Theorem 7.3 — Grassmannian holonomy around any non-contractible coordination loop is non-trivial, providing permanent topological memory
• Theorem 9.2 — The total holonomy invariant ℋ is strictly non-decreasing, enforcing the Second Law in all disclosed embodiments

The Agda source successfully type-checks with no unsolved metavariables or unsafe options (flags: --cubical --safe). HTML rendering and GitHub repository are provided for examiner verification.

All files type-check with **Agda 2.6.4.3 + --cubical --safe**
