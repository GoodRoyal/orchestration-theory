NOTICE OF PUBLIC FORMAL VERIFICATION
AND PRIOR-ART REFERENCE
(Applicable to this Provisional Patent Application)

Inventor: Juan Carlos Paredes  
Date: November 26, 2025  

The subject matter disclosed in this provisional patent application has been formally verified using machine-checked proofs in Cubical Agda (version 2.6.4+, standard library 2.0).

A complete, type-checking, literate Agda development that proves the central non-obvious mathematical properties of the invention — including perpendicular divergence, Grassmannian holonomy, and thermodynamic holonomy — is publicly available at:

https://github.com/GoodRoyal/orchestration-theory

This repository contains:
• A unified literate proof document (ParedesOrchestrationTheory.lagda.md)
• Individual appendices corresponding to each provisional filing
• HTML rendering generated via agda --html
• A permanent archival DOI via Zenodo (to be assigned upon release)

The repository was made public on or before November 26, 2025 and serves simultaneously as:
1. Timestamped evidence of conception and reduction to practice
2. Machine-verifiable enablement under 35 U.S.C. § 112(a)
3. Public disclosure within the inventor’s one-year grace period under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b)(1)

This disclosure is intentionally made by the inventor and does not constitute prior art that bars patentability of the claims ultimately presented in any non-provisional application claiming benefit of this provisional.

Inventor acknowledges that the contents of the above-referenced GitHub repository and its associated Zenodo archive form part of the public record and may be cited by the USPTO or third parties for any lawful purpose.
